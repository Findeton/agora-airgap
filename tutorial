To start the openrisc simulator with linux, you need two terminals, one to start the sim and another to connect to it through telnet.

Open terminal number 1 and execute:

$ cd openrisc/or1ksim
$ sudo ./brstart.sh openrisc openrisc br0 eth0 tap0

Now open terminal number 2:

$ cd openrisc/linux
$ or32-elf-sim -f arch/openksim.cfg vmlinux

Once linux boots, go back to terminal 1 to connect to the machine through telnet (it will ask you for a user, just enter root):

$ telnet 10.0.2.16
